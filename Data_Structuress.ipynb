        "\n",
        "   - The placement of elements depends on the hash values of keys, not on the order in which they were inserted.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - That is why dictionaries are considered unordered collections.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- How it Affects Data Retrieval:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - You cannot access dictionary items by an index (like in lists).\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Data retrieval is always done by using the key, not by position.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Order of items should not be relied upon for algorithms that depend on sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - my_dict = {\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}\n",
        "\n",
        "    - print(my_dict[\"b\"])   # Access by key → 2\n",
        "-  No index-based access like my_dict[0]\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- So, dictionaries are considered unordered because they are designed for fast key-based lookups, not positional storage."
